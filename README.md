# Vishwajit Ishwar Patil

Backend Engineer (Java | Spring Boot) with a strong interest in building scalable, reliable systems and a parallel fascination with game development as a technical and creative discipline.

I enjoy working close to system constraints — concurrency, data consistency, performance trade-offs — and I treat game development as a sandbox to experiment with real-time logic, state management, and performance-sensitive design.

---

## 🔧 What I Do Professionally
- Design and build **backend systems** using Java and Spring Boot
- Work with **relational and NoSQL databases** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Implement **secure authentication and RBAC** using Spring Security and JWT
- Think in terms of **scalability, reliability, and failure modes**
- Prefer learning through **documentation, research papers, and hands-on debugging**

## 🎮 Game Development (Serious Hobby)
Game development is not just a side interest for me — it sharpens my engineering instincts.

Through game dev, I explore:
- Real-time systems and state synchronization
- Performance optimization under tight constraints
- Event-driven architectures
- Game logic, physics, and AI experimentation

I see game development as a way to strengthen:
- Problem decomposition
- Debugging discipline
- System-level thinking under pressure

---

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset
- Ownership-driven problem solving
- Rapid adaptation to technical constraints
- Comfortable with ambiguity and iterative design
- Focused on correctness first, optimization next

I value **understanding why systems fail**, not just making them work.
