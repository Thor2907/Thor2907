## 🧠 Engineering Identity

- Backend-focused engineer working primarily with **Java and Spring Boot**
- Strong emphasis on **data consistency, concurrency, and system reliability**
- Comfortable operating close to system limits and failure modes
- Learn through **documentation, research papers, and debugging real systems**

---

## 🎮 Game Development — More Than a Hobby

Game development sharpens my engineering instincts.

It helps me explore:
- Real-time state management
- Event-driven systems
- Performance optimization under tight constraints
- Debugging complex, fast-changing logic

I treat game dev as **serious engineering practice**, not just visual output.
